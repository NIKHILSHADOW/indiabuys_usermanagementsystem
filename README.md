# USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a secure web-based system built to manage and interact with users in a structured way. Here's how it works:

### Login and Registration

New users can register using their email and password.

Existing users must log in to access any features or data.

### User Roles

There are two types of users:

Admin: Has full control over the system.

Regular User: Has limited access for personal and social actions.

### What Admins Can Do

View all registered users.

Access and manage user data as needed.

### What Regular Users Can Do

View their own profile and make changes (edit or delete).

View other users' profiles, but only if they know the userâ€™s ID.

Follow or unfollow other users to know other person.

See the number of people they follow and who follows them.

### Smart Search

A search bar allows users to search for others by their ID to view limited profile info and follow/unfollow options.

### Security

All actions are protected: users must be logged in to view or interact with data.

Only Admins can access sensitive or system-wide information.
